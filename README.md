# Quine-McCluskey
Implementation of Quine McCluskey method for the research of the minimum form of a single logic formula specifying a ON set and a DC set.
If you want to see the code look for it in the src folder.
If you only want to use it, instead, download the jar archive and execute the application using the command
java -jar [PATH]QuineMcCluskey.jar
in the terminal (linux and macOS) or in the command prompt (windows), specifiyng the whole path of the jar file.
This is a console application: there is no GUI, so it's not possible to open it by clicking twice on the jar archive.
To use this application JRE must be installed.
